# Project overview of a mini todoApp

## Overview
This is a simple mini todo app which can basically add, remove, edit and delete items from a list of todo's that a user might have inserted manually. It also uses the Local Storage API which means a user can still access the items when the page has been refreshed so that his data is not lost.

## Tech Stack
For this project I used HTML for markup and Tailwind for styling to make the process faster and finally JavaScript for the interactivity and functionality of the application.

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the local Storage JavaScript API.
